# Typhon Page

This responsive front-page is a mock design for a fictional gaming computers and accessories website.

Created with Bootstrap and Jquery. It has an original logo design, as well as artwork on the slider, and it plays with CSS transitions to offer an interactive experience.

### Installing

Because it is built with only native CSS and a bootstrap CDN you don't need to install anything. Just open index.html on your browser.
